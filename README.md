# 🔗 URL Shortener Backend Assignment (1–2 hours)

## 📌 Objective
Build a minimal RESTful backend service in Go that shortens long URLs and supports basic redirection. This exercise tests clean API design, data modeling, and minimal persistence logic.


## 📦 Requirements

### 1. Core Functionality

Implement a service that allows users to:
- Create a short URL from a long one
- Redirect users who visit the short URL to the original one

**Note: You are free to use gRPC or HTTP, your choice.  The provided template offers flexibility to use either.**


### 2. RESTful API Endpoints

`POST /api/shortlinks`

Create a new short link

**Request:**

```json
  {
    "original_url": "https://example.com"
  }
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "short_url": "http://localhost:8080/shortlinks/abc123"
}
```

`GET /api/shortlinks/{id}`

Retrieve details of a short link

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "original_url": "https://example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

`GET /shortlinks/{id}`

**Public redirect endpoint** – 302 redirect to the original URL
**Response:** HTTP 302 with `Location: original_url`


## 💾 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Go
* **Framework**: Any (Chi, Gin, Echo, or `net/http`)
* **Storage**: Use an in-memory map or SQLite/Postgres (your choice)


## ✅ Constraints

* Short code (`short_code`) should be 6–8 alphanumeric characters
* Must validate that `original_url` is a valid URL
* No authentication, no UI
* Assume `http://localhost:8080` as base URL


## 🧪 Bonus (Optional, if you have time)

* [ ] Handle duplicate original URLs by returning the existing short code
* [ ] Add basic unit tests


## 📤 Submission

- Please submit your project as a private repository on GitHub, with an invitation to `joel at elishah dot biz` Username: `dashyonah`.
- Send an email to `joel at elishah dot biz` with the link to the private repository.

- Please include in your README.md:
  - Setup instructions
  - Sample `cURL` commands or a Postman collection link to download and test

- In your code, you should have:
  - SQL schema/migration files where needed
  - Clear folder structure and idiomatic Go code
  - Tests
